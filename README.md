# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of houses based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other house characteristics. Two machine learning models are used for prediction:

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple linear approach to model the relationship between house features and price.
2. **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that improves predictions by combining multiple decision trees.

## Key Steps:
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Categorical columns were converted into binary (0/1) values.
  - Missing values were handled using mean imputation.
- **Visualization**: 
  - Visualized the distribution of house prices.
  - Used a heatmap to understand correlations between features.
- **Modeling**:
  - Both Linear Regression and Random Forest models were trained on the dataset, and their predictions were compared.
  
## Results:
- The project evaluates model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualizations provide insights into the impact of various features on the price prediction.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Dataset**: House pricing data with features describing house conditions and configurations.
